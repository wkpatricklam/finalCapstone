## Description

The `finance_calculators.py` program provides two options for financial calculations: investment and bond repayment. Users can choose the desired calculation by selecting from the provided menu options. Here's a brief overview of each calculation:

- Investment: Calculates the amount of interest you'll earn on an investment based on the principal amount, interest rate, time period, and the type of interest (simple or compound).
